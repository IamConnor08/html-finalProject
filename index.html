                    <h3>1. HTML Fundamentals Project</h3>
                        <p>This was my very first HTML project. It is very simple as I was just learning about 
                    the most basic HTML structures like h1, h2, h3, and p. I made a very simplistic webpage
                    listing my top 3 favorite movies.</p>

                        <p>My second HTML project built on what I learned in my first project. I learned and 
                    untilized the use list in HTML and how there is unorder "ul" and  order "ol" lists. I 
                    also utilized links in the project as well is how to implementhomeImg using their source. 
                    I also added some HTML syling in the project but, I would learn in later project this 
                    is not ideal.</p>

                    <h3>3. HTML Resume Project</h3>
                        <p>For my third project I created my resume using HTML. This project helped 
                    with building a clean layout and structure with HTML. I also used two new 
                    methods, the first was links to other HTML files I created. The second was 
                    using a footer and copyright statement at the end of my resume.</p>

                    <h3>4. HTML and CSS Blog Project</h3>
                        <p>This project I created a Blog about myself but used CSS for sytling. The code
                    is quite messy as at the time I didn't realize it was better to keep
                    HTML and CSS is separate files. Overall all though I did learn a lot
                    about CSS, some of what I learned in this project indludes: padding, margins, 
                    transitions, hover, font-family, ect. </p>

                    <h3>5. CSS Media and Classes Project</h3>
                        <p>For my most recent project I learned and utilized the use of classes in CSS.
                    Classes are very powerful and important as you can make changes to a group
                    of elements all at once without affecting other things. I also utilized "@Media"
                    which can change the layout of your website depedning on screen size like
                    deskstop and mobile.</p>
