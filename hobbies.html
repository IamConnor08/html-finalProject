                <h3>Basketball</h3>
                <p>Basketball has been a huge aspect of my life since 4th grade. I fell in love
                    with the game around the time and ever since then I have been playing it and
                    watching it closely. My favorite team is the Golden State Warriors and my 
                    favorite player is Stephen Curry.

                <h3>Film</h3>
                <p>Watching movies has been a growing hobby of mine in recent years. I have 
                    always loved watching movies but as time has passes on I have enjoyed watching
                    movies in a more critical way. I enjoy watching movies that really make you think
                    and pick your brain. some of my favorite movies are Blade Runner 2049, Interstellar,
                    and Shawshank Redemption.

                <h3>Cooking</h3>
                <p>Making food has also been another growing hobby of mine. I enjoy the aspect of 
                    cooking and like to try new recipies. I find it relaxing after a long day but 
                    I also think it is an incredibly valuable skill as it can save you so much money
                    from eating out. Some of my favorite foods include: steak, french fries, and buffalo
                    wings

                <h3>Cars</h3>
                <p>Watching reviews and looking at cars for sale near me is one of my favorite things
                    to do. I am no gearhead by anymeans but I enjoy learning about how cars and how to 
                    fix them. I also like seeing what new cars are capable of and what new technology
                    they bring. Right now a currently drive a Mustange GT and it was fun for a while
                    but the older I have gotten I have yearned for something more practicle like a truck.
                    Some vehicles I currently interested in include: Toyota Tocoma, Subaru WRX, and a 
                    Nissian Frontier.

                <h3>Computers</h3>
                <p>As a Computer Science Major it is natural for me to have an intrest in computers.
                    I like to learn and understand how they work on a deeper level compared to the 
                    average person and I am consistnly amazed by their complexities. I have also been
                    recently interested an aquiring a new computer. Some of the ones I am considering
                    are the Mac mini, iMac, or building my own.

                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>I have been playing video games every since I could remeber. From playing on my
                    parents old desktop and the PS2 to know playing on the PS5. My favorite thing about
                    playing video games is not the games it's self but being about to connect with
                    friends. Althought recently I have not been playing much recently due to other 
                    life priorities I still enjoy it whenever I do get the chance. Some of my favorite
                    video games of all time are Black Ops 3, Rainbow Six Siege, and NBA2K.
